\section{Task 8 Optional}

I have port my codes to Raijin GPUs.

To do that, you should \lstinline{module load cuda} firstly.
And then you need modify your Makefile to \lstinline{nvcc $(CCFLAGS) -lcuda -lcudart -c $*.cu}.
Then you should modify your batch to \lstinline{#PBS -q gpu \n #PBS -l ngpus=2 \n #PBS -l ncpus=6}
to use Kepler80.

I perform the experiment on Raijin with parameters $M=N=600, r=10$ with $Gx=Gy=2, Bx=By=16$ without -o option,
The time cost is $2.617\times 10^{-2}$s. 

I also run the same experiment on Jetson1 with the same parameters as above without -o option.
The time cost on Jetson1 is $6.288\times 10^{-2}$s, which is much slower than Raijin.
