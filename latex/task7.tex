\section{Task 7 Comparison of the Programming Models}

OpenMP is the easiest to program. You just write the serial program firstly, and
add some directives. It is relative easy to debug.

CUDA is also easy to program. But if one want to write a program with high efficieny,
it will become difficult. Since there are many kinds of memories, including the 
global mem, shared mem, constant mem and texture mem, and it requires lots of
skills and experiences to fully make use of all kinds of memories. It is also
relative easy to debug. The speedup is 

MPI is the most difficult to program. It is difficult to design the message passing
strategy, to implement the parallel code. And the most important is that it is very 
difficult to debug.

The speedup cannot be compared directly. 
In fact, for $M=N=600, r=10$ and $4$ threads/processors, the speedup of Cuda is $3\%$,
which is much slower than CPU. Since the strategy of GPU is different from CPU.
There are lots of SP on a GPU. The strategy of GPU speedup is to use lots of SP
to do SIMD calculations. However, for OpenMP and MPI, there will not such many
threads/processors as GPU's SP. But every thread/processor will run much faster 
than SP in GPU. The speedup between MPI and OpenMP is case by case. It will
determined by the program. Generally, the prefactor of $t_s$ term in OpenMP will be 
smaller than that in MPI.
