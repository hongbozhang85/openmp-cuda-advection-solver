\section{Task 4 Optional}

We use the \lstinline{#pragma omp simd} to improve the performance further.
I only apply this extra optimization to 1D case. However,
it is easy to extends to 2D case.

I do two experiments with $M=N=200$ and $r=100$.
With simd, the time cost is $4.295\times 10^{-3}$s. While without simd,
the time cost is $5.222\times 10^{-3}$s.

Obviously, it has improved a lot.
