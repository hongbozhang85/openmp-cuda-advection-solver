\section{Task 6 Optimized GPU Implementation}

I use shared memory to do optimization. Since access to shared memory is much 
faster than the access to the global memory. It will improve the performance 
by reduce the memory access time. In every r iteration, using shared memory will
have overhead of copying from global memory to local memory and several synchronization.
Consequently, the two effects will compete.

I implement in following steps.
 0. update halo of u field. \\
 1. copy boundary from global memory u to shared memory cu. \\
 2. copy center grid from global memory u to shared memory cu. \\
 3. synchronize \\
 4. updateAdvect1 of cu, cut \\
 5. synchronize \\
 6. updateAdvect2 of cu, cut \\
 7. synchronize \\
 8. write cu back to u \\

I do experiment with $M=N=600, r=10, Gx=Gy=2, Bx=By=16$. 
The optimized time cost is $1.987\times 10^{-3}$.
While the non-optimized time cost is $6.221\times 10^{-2}$.
So it improves a lot.
